# R Suite with Python

Sometimes your R project may need access to a pyton library. In this chapter we will show you how
to manage *internal* python environment with R substitute

## Preliminaries

We are using:

* [R v. 3.4.2](http://r-project.org)
* [Anaconda v. 5.0.1](https://www.anaconda.com/).
* [R Suite v. 0.18-224](http://rsuite.io)

## Step 1 - create your R Suite project

```bash
rsuite proj start -n rsuite_eats_python
cd rsuite_eats_python
```

## Step 2 - create python environment in your R Suite project

```bash
conda create -p python python=3.6
```

This command will create folder `python` in your R Suite project.

## Step 3 - make `PyhonLoader` R package

```bash
rsuite proj pkgadd -n PythonLoader
```

This package will handle python initialization using [reticulate package](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate).
