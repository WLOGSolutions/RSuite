VERSION 0.19 (2017-11-22)
  * Detection imports in package NAMESPACE fixed to support comma separated lists.
  * Defaut set_env.R fixed to create user specific log file if has no access to default.
  * Version restriction handling fixed, tests created.
  * GitHub package building fixed to support Git repositories requiring all Git
     repository structure to build properly (e.g. Microsoft/LightGBM).
  * There is not requirement for package to have same name as package folder.

VERSION 0.18 (2017-11-13)
  * #150: checking if R version is available early while installing deps, building,
     zipping and packing.
  * for R3.4 it does not creates PACAKGES.rds (and removes it if found in repo) as
     it does not support multiple package versions.

VERSION 0.17 (2017-11-11)
  * prj_pack can be told to pack only selected project packages or not to include
     master scripts in the pack.
  * fixed bug in package version requirements detection. It used to create large
     available packages set with duplicates.
  * fixed error with handling imports with dot in name.
  * debian & redhat OS version detection corrected
  * if NAMESPACE file of source package is built with roxygen, before building
     documentation non present imports from DESCRIPTIO are appended. Previously
     they replaced content.
  * while building source packages to binary form neither documentation is
     rebuilded nor imports validity testing is performed.
     e.g. withr source package does not have all requirements to build documentation.
  * while building source packages to binary form Rcpp:compileAttributes is skipped.
     It does not not work properly with newest Rcpp (e.g. for plyr).
  * updating of PACKAGES.rds fixed while uploading to S3 repository.

VERSION 0.16 (2017-11-08)
  * Project zip can be created for projects without master scripts.
  * prj_pack function added to export project sources. It is usefull for building
     project in docker and for giving project sources your peers to play with it.

VERSION 0.15 (2017-11-04)
  * Creation of PKGZIP with dependencies and filtering against packages existing
     in passed repository.
  * Uploading packages into repository together with dependencies and filtering
     against existing packages present in it.

VERSION 0.14 (2017-10-30)
  * Handling of multiple Dir repositories in project fixed.

VERSION 0.13 (2017-10-23)
  * #146: After installing package it is checked if it was built for proper
     R version. MRAN has packages built under 3.3.2 presented as built for 3.4.
  * Failure of building documentation for package is considered major error as
     roxygen also builds NAMESPACE file which is responsible for project exports
     and imports. Failure to properly declare NAMESPACE will make package unusable.
  * Detection if post documentation build imports in package DESCRIPTION file and
     NAMESPACE file are consistent. NAMESPACE is updated if has some packages
     declared in DESCRIPTION missing.

VERSION 0.12 (2017-10-16)
  * RStudio basic integration implemented. Dependency to rstudioapi added.
  * sbox folder added beside deployment/libs for libraries installed by the user.
  * #147: Building package documentation for unpriviledged user fixed.
  * #141: prj_zip does not require project to be under version control. Version
     is detected out of PARAMETERS/ZipVersion and packages version if formet not
     exists.
  * #143: Clean dependencies RSuite addin added.

VERSION 0.11 (2017-10-12)
  * Handling of .libPath during project package build: it currently contains
     also user library path.
  * #140: Building package documentation then package has dependencies fixed.

VERSION 0.10 (2017-09-24)
  * Fixed handling of .libPath during prj_deps_inst and prj_build.
  * logging moved to Imports in RSuite and created projects.

VERSION 0.9 (2017-09-20)

VERSION 0.8 (2017-09-13)
  * Dependencies are checked both binary and source iteratively until they are
       all satisfied (deep dependency search).
  * Repository order is important: former repositories are checked for
       dependencies before later ones. If proper version is found latter
       repositories will not be checked to satisfy it.

VERSION 0.7 (2017-09-12)
  * Packages are not detached during build if they are loaded from another
       location then project environment
  * Repository manager is separated out of repository adapter.
  * Packages from github can be uploaded into a repository or packed into PKGZIP.
  * Setting RVersion for package added into API.

  * SVN adapter fixed to properly detect if project is under RC then creating
  * SVN adapter fixed to properly remove svn:externals from project directory
  * Fixed deployment scripts to properly reference logging package
  * Documentation fixed not to contain internals
  * Dependencies consistency detection while building project implemented
  * Project packages are built before building zip package. If RC revision is
      detected it is added to versions of project backages before building.
  * Repository adapters added for CRAN and MRAN. Detection if repository is
      reliable realized. Warning is logged if any of repositories is not.
  * Got rid of miniCRAN dependency.
  * S3 and Dir repository management added. Project packages can be uploaded
      into repository as binary or source packages. User also can upload
      arbitrary package files into repository.
