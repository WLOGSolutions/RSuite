VERSION 0.16 (2017-11-08)
  * Project zip can be created for projects without master scripts.

VERSION 0.13 (2017-10-23)
  * #146: After installing package it is checked if it was built for proper
     R version. MRAN has packages built under 3.3.2 presented as built for 3.4.
  * Failure of building documentation for package is considered major error as
     roxygen also builds NAMESPACE file which is responsible for project exports
     and imports. Failure to properly declare NAMESPACE will make package unusable.

     NAMESPACE file are consistent. NAMESPACE is updated if has some packages
     declared in DESCRIPTION missing.

       repositories will not be checked to satisfy it.

VERSION 0.7 (2017-09-12)
  * Packages are not detached during build if they are loaded from another

  * Repository adapters added for CRAN and MRAN. Detection if repository is
      reliable realized. Warning is logged if any of repositories is not.
  * Got rid of miniCRAN dependency.
  * S3 and Dir repository management added. Project packages can be uploaded
